# Machine Learning with Python: Weather Conditions and Climate Change Analysis with ClimateWins

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze historical weather patterns and predict future climate scenarios across Europe. Working as a data analyst for ClimateWins, a nonprofit organization focused on climate resilience, this project explores the potential for machine learning to forecast the effects of climate change—ranging from extreme weather trends to safer habitation zones within the next few decades.

## Objective

Building on foundational machine learning concepts, this project delves into advanced models, particularly in unsupervised learning. The aim is to identify emerging weather patterns, assess shifts in regional norms, and anticipate future weather outcomes. Key tasks include:

- Discovering new patterns in European weather changes over the last 60 years
- Identifying and evaluating increases in unusual weather events
- Projecting possible climate scenarios for the next 25–50 years
- Highlighting potentially safer areas for future habitation in response to climate migration

## Data
The analysis relies on comprehensive historical data collected from 18 weather stations across Europe, courtesy of the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project. This dataset spans daily observations from the late 1800s to 2022, encompassing parameters like temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. The dataset is organized in the following directory structure:

Data Sets/ – Houses all raw data files for easy access
Supervised/ and Unsupervised/ – Subdirectories for respective model data

## Methods
This project leverages both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to:

- Analyze historical data for new weather trends
- Predict patterns and anomalies with advanced composite and unsupervised models
- Generate projections for regional climate impact assessments

## Project Deliverables

Throughout the project, the focus remains on identifying machine learning tools and models best suited for ClimateWins' objectives. The final deliverables will include recommendations for algorithms, required resources, and data preprocessing techniques essential for accurate climate predictions. The insights and models produced will aim to enhance ClimateWins’ ability to address climate change with data-driven foresight.
